    <!--
      A simple idle village management game inspired by Tribal Wars, Kingshot and
      Clash of Clans. Players collect resources, build and upgrade structures
      and watch their village grow over time. All logic is handled in
      script.js and data is persisted using localStorage so progress is
      preserved between sessions.
